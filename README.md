## Installation

The recommended way to install Docker PHP is of course to use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require prestainfra/docker-php
```

## Docker API Version

By default it will use the last version of docker api available, if you want to fix a version (like 1.41) you can add this
requirement to composer:

```bash
composer require "prestainfra/docker-php-api:6.1.41.*"
```

## Usage

See [the documentation](http://docker-php.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

## Unit Tests

Setup the test suite using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) if not already done:

```
$ composer install --dev
```

Run it using [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/):

```
$ composer test
```
